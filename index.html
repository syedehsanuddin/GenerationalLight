                            Kossay was the fifth in descent from Fihr, and was born about 398 a.c.

                            The Khuzaites remained in possession of the temple, and of all

                            a descendant of Fihr, who had married Holayl's daughter, drove
                            the Khuzaites out of Mecca, and possessed himself of the entire
                            power, both secular and religious, in the city, and thus became the
                            virtual ruler of Hijaz. We now arrive on absolutelyhistorical

                            Until Kossay's time, the different Koraishite families had lived dispersed in
                            separate
                            quarters, at considerable
                            distances from the Kaaba, and the extreme sanctity they
                            attached to the temple had prevented their erecting any habitation
                            in its neighbourhood. Perceiving the dangers to which the national
                            pantheon was exposed from its unprotected condition, he induced
                            the Koraish to settle in its vicinity, leavinga sufficient space free on the four
                            sides of
                            the temple for the tawaf (circumambulation).
                            The families, to whom the lands were allotted, dwelt in strongly fortified quarters.

                        <p class="footer__text">
                            Kossay appears to have made himself the master of Mecca
                            about the middle of the fifth century of the Christian era, and he at once set
                            himself to
                            the task of placing the administration of the
                            city upon an organised basis.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Kossay built for himself a palace, the door of which opened on
                            the platform of the temple. This palace was called the Dar un Nadwa, "The council
                            hall" ,where, under the presidency of
                            Kossay, public affairs were discussed and transacted. To this hall,
                            no man under the age of forty, unless a descendant of Kossay,
                            could gain admission. Here also were performed all civil functions.
                            At the Dar un-Nadwa, the Koraishites, when about to engage in
                            a war, received from the hands of Kossay the standard, Liwa. Kossay
                            himself attached to the end of a lance a piece of white stuff, and
                            handed it, or sent it by one of his sons, to the Koraishite chiefs.
                            This ceremony, called the Akd ul-liwa, continued in vogue from the
                            time of its inauguration by Kossay until the very end of the Arab
                            empire.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another of Kossay's institutions endured much longer.
                            By representing to the Koraish the necessity of providing food for
                            the poor pilgrims who annually visited Mecca, and by impressing
                            on them the duties of hospitality, Kossay succeeded in making them
                            submit to the payment of an annual poor-tax, called the Rifada,
                            which he applied in feeding the poorer pilgrims during the Ayyam ul-Mina -the day of
                            the
                            sacrificialfeast, and the two following days
                            which they passed at Mina. This usage continued after the establishment
                            of Islam, and was the origin of the distribution of food which
                            was made at Mina. each year during the pilgrimage, in the name of
                            the Caliphs and the Sultans,their successors.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With these dignities, Kossay also held the administration
                            of the water suppliedby the wells in Mecca and its neighbourhood
                            "Sikaya", and the custodyof the keys of the Kaaba "Hijaba", with
                            the ministration to the worshipof the gods.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Kossay thus united in his own person all the principal religious,
                            civil, and political functions. He was king, magistrate, and chief
                            pontiff. His power, which was almost royal, threw great lustre on
                            the tribe of Koraish, of whom he was the acknowledged chief, and
                            from his time the Koraish acquired a marked preponderance among
                            the other descendants of Ishmael.

                        Quraysh tribe and the city of Mecca. His achievements, including the reconstruction

                        had a lasting impact on the religious and political dynamics of pre-Islamic Arabia.

                    major religions stemming from the legacy of Abraham—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—it is important
                    to acknowledge the rich diversity within each faith. Variations in beliefs, practices, and
                    interpretations exist among different denominations, such as Shia and Sunni within Islam, Catholic
                    and Protestant within Christianity, and different perspectives within Judaism, including Orthodox,
                    Conservative, and Reform. Additionally, Unitarians and other sects contribute to the multifaceted
                    nature of religious traditions. It is crucial to recognize and respect the diversity of religious
                    views and perspectives, as individuals and communities may hold unique interpretations and
                    traditions within the broader framework of these faiths.</p>
